# SecureLogin

SecureLogin is a personal project developed using Angular. It is a simple authentication system with login functionality implemented using Angular Guards. The project consists of an authentication page where users are required to enter their credentials (username and password). Depending on the type of credentials entered (regular user or admin), the corresponding page is displayed. The routes are protected to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring a secure login process.
